// Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include
// in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is 
// as large as possible. 

// In Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack. 
// This problem in which we can break an item is also called the fractional knapsack problem.
